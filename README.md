# LeVel’s LRC Editor

A simple java + swing application to create and edit .lrc files.

# Features

-Create and edit .lrc files.
-Insert the lyrics as plain text in the "Add Lyrics" tab, and add timestamps in the "Edit Lyrics" tab.
-Listen to songs through a (rather simple) mp3 player.
-Set timestamps in real time (by selecting a lyric in the "Edit Lyrics" tab and pressing the Space Bar while the song is playing).
-Adjust all timestamps by a specified amount of time by pressing "CTRL + T".

Made for personal use in my free time, feel free to try it! (Just don’t expect anything *too* fancy.)
