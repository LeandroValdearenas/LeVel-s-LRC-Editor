# LeVel's LRC Editor

A simple java + swing application to edit and (eventually) create .lrc files from .mp3 files.

At the moment you can only update existing .lrc files. Song reproduction and creating files from scratch will come later, as well as improved keyboard control.

Made for personal use in my free time, feel free to try it! (Just don't expect anything *too* fancy.)
