# LeVel’s LRC Editor

A simple java + swing application to create and edit .lrc files.

At the moment you can create and edit .lrc files, and you can listen to .mp3 files in a (very simple) mp3 player.
Future plans include being able to set timestamps in real time with the mp3 player, as well as improved keyboard control.
The menu bar will also get some extra functionalities as I see fit, we’ll see how it goes.

Made for personal use in my free time, feel free to try it! (Just don’t expect anything *too* fancy.)
