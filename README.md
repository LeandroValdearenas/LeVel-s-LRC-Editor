# LeVel's LRC Editor

A simple java application to edit and (eventually) create .lrc files from .mp3 files.
At the moment you can only update an existing .lrc file, song reproduction and creating files from scratch will come later. (As well as improved keyboard control.)

Made for personal use in my free time, feel free to use! (Don't expect anything too fancy.)
